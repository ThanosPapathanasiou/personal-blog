# This is the code I use to generate my blog

I use this repository to generate the static site that is in thanospapathanasiou.github.io

I found that eleventy was the simplest static site generator to use but integrating it with github was a pain. So, instead of integrating it, I just have two repositories. This one that has the code and the thanospapathanasiou.github.io that basically has the _site output.
